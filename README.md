# WhosGot – MVP Skeleton

**Because asking is human.**  
**Ask the world. Someone will answer.**

This is a minimal hand-crafted skeleton for the WhosGot MVP while waiting for GitHub Spark.

## What’s inside
- Next.js (pages directory) – simple static UI
- Express backend – mock API for requests
- PostgreSQL schema – starter SQL
- `.env.example` – environment template

## Quick start
```bash
# 1) Install deps
npm install

# 2) Run Next.js dev server (http://localhost:3000)
npm run dev

# 3) In another terminal, run the backend (http://localhost:5000)
npm run server
```

> Note: This is a lightweight scaffold for demo & iteration. When Spark is available,
> generate the full project using `prompt.md` and migrate code as needed.
